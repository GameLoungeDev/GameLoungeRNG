    <h2>🧠 About Us</h2>
    <p>Game Lounge is an unpredictable, high-energy livestream games platform built for entertainment, community, and deflationary crypto economics. This isn’t just a game — it’s an experiment in building something real, raw, and rewarding from the ground up.</p>
    <p>We’re not launching with studio lighting and million-dollar sets. We’re starting this in a room, with makeshift props, DIY games, and a big vision. Over time, with the community’s support, we’ll grow this into a full-blown livestreaming production — with custom game setups, studio-grade streaming, and a vibrant ecosystem that gives back.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re watching, playing, or just vibing, you’re part of something we’re building together — from scratch.</p>

    <h2>🎮 Available Games</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🎲 Dice Roll</li>
      <li>🎲 Dice Roll – How It Works
This isn’t your average roll.

Each game starts with a mix of colorful dice, but there's only one that matters — the red die.

All the dice go into the cup…
They’re shaken live on stream…
And rolled onto the playing board.

We’re only watching the red die’s result each time.

We keep rolling until we get three unique numbers from the red die.
These become the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners — in the order they appear.

It’s all about the red.
Fast, visual, and 100% real.</li>
      <li>🃏 Card Draw</li>
      <li>🎁 Mystery Box</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🔄 New games will be added to the wheel. Once we reach 5 games we will continue to create games and add them to a list so we can the games on the board on a weekly basis. Suggestions welcome. Chaos guaranteed.</p>
