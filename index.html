    <h2>🧠 About Us</h2>
    <p>Game Lounge is an unpredictable, high-energy livestream games platform built for entertainment, community, and deflationary crypto economics. This isn’t just a game — it’s an experiment in building something real, raw, and rewarding from the ground up.</p>
    <p>We’re not launching with studio lighting and million-dollar sets. We’re starting this in a room, with makeshift props, DIY games, and a big vision. Over time, with the community’s support, we’ll grow this into a full-blown livestreaming production — with custom game setups, studio-grade streaming, and a vibrant ecosystem that gives back.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re watching, playing, or just vibing, you’re part of something we’re building together — from scratch.</p>

    <h2>🎮 Available Games</h2>
    <h3>🎲 Dice Roll – How It Works</h3>
    <p>Each game starts with a mix of colorful dice, but there's only one that matters — the red die. All the dice go into the cup, are shaken live on stream, and rolled onto the board. We keep rolling until we get three unique numbers from the red die. These become the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners — in the order they appear.</p>

    <h3>🃏 Card Draw – How It Works</h3>
    <p>A standard deck is shown on camera, shuffled three times using an automatic shuffler, and given one clean cut. Cards are drawn one at a time. We only care about Ace through 6. Once we draw three unique numbers from that range, they become the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners.</p>

    <h3>🎁 Mystery Box – How It Works</h3>
    <p>Six mystery boxes are numbered 1 through 6. Three of them contain Bitcoin tokens. A random number generator decides which box is opened next. We continue opening boxes until three Bitcoin boxes are revealed. Those become our 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners.</p>

    <p>🔄 New games will be added to the wheel. Once we reach 5 games, we'll rotate weekly. Suggestions welcome. Chaos guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>💎 Tokenomics</h2>
    <p>Every week, 100% of the show's earnings are used to buy back tokens from the market. At the end of each month, 50% of those tokens are burned — until the target supply of 100,000,000 is reached.</p>
    <p>Once the target is met, weekly buybacks are reduced to 50% of house earnings, and burning stops. The remaining 50% supports the show's treasury.</p>
    <p>The treasury fuels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎥 Production & Streaming Upgrades</li>
      <li>📢 Marketing & Promotions</li>
      <li>🌍 Platform Expansion</li>
      <li>🎉 Weekly Community Jackpot Payouts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📈 Token Utility (Evolving)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In-game advantages</li>
      <li>Entry to premium prize pools</li>
      <li>Vote on new games</li>
      <li>Future staking, rewards, and tiers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>🤝 Community Growth</h3>
    <p>This is built for everyone. As we grow, so do your tokens.</p>
