    <h2>🧠 About Us</h2>
    <p>Game Lounge is an unpredictable, high-energy livestream games platform built for entertainment, community, and deflationary crypto economics. This isn’t just a game — it’s an experiment in building something real, raw, and rewarding from the ground up.</p>
    <p>We’re not launching with studio lighting and million-dollar sets. We’re starting this in a room, with makeshift props, DIY games, and a big vision. Over time, with the community’s support, we’ll grow this into a full-blown livestreaming production — with custom game setups, studio-grade streaming, and a vibrant ecosystem that gives back.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re watching, playing, or just vibing, you’re part of something we’re building together — from scratch.</p>

    <h2>🎮 Available Games</h2>
    <ul>
      
      <li>🎲 Dice Roll – How It Works
This isn’t your average roll.

Each game starts with a mix of colorful dice, but there's only one that matters — the red die.

All the dice go into the cup…
They’re shaken live on stream…
And rolled onto the playing board.

We’re only watching the red die’s result each time.

We keep rolling until we get three unique numbers from the red die.
These become the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners — in the order they appear.

It’s all about the red.
Fast, visual, and 100% real.</li>
      <li>🃏 Card Draw – How It Works
A full deck. A clean shuffle. And only six cards that matter.

The game begins with a standard deck of cards, shown live on camera to keep it 100% transparent.

The deck is:

Shuffled three times using an automatic shuffler

Given one clean cut for fairness

Then the real action starts.

Cards are drawn one at a time, but we’re only looking for cards numbered 1 through 6 (Ace through 6).
All other cards are ignored.

🎯 The moment we pull three different numbers from that 1–6 range — the game ends.

🏆 The first unique number drawn = 1st Place
🥈 The second = 2nd Place
🥉 The third = 3rd Place

Everything is live.
Everything is chance.
Only the numbers 1–6 decide your fate.</li>
      <li>🎁 Mystery Box – How It Works
Six boxes. Three hidden Bitcoins. One wild reveal.

At the start of the game, six mystery boxes are placed on camera — each numbered 1 through 6.
Three of them contain Bitcoin tokens, and the rest junk.

Once the game begins, we use a random number generator to decide which box to open first.
We’ll continue generating numbers and opening boxes one by one — live and unedited.

Only the boxes that contain Bitcoin matter.

As soon as we open three different Bitcoin boxes, the game ends.

🏆 The first Bitcoin found = 1st Place
🥈 The second = 2nd Place
🥉 The third = 3rd Place

It’s part luck. Part suspense.
And all mystery — until the last Bitcoin is revealed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🔄 New games will be added to the wheel. Once we reach 5 games we will continue to create games and add them to a list so we can the games on the board on a weekly basis. Suggestions welcome. Chaos guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>💎 Tokenomics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supply: 1,000,000,000,000 initial / 100,000,000 goal</li>
      <li>How It Works
Our token model is designed for growth, scarcity, and community rewards.

🧾 Weekly Buybacks:
Every week, 100% of the show's earnings are used to buy back tokens from the open market. This helps drive value and reward early holders.

🔥 Monthly Burns:
At the end of every month, 50% of the purchased tokens are burned — permanently removed from supply — until we reach our target supply.

🎯 Once the Supply Goal is Reached:

Weekly buybacks are reduced to 50% of house earnings

Burning stops permanently

The remaining 50% supports the show's treasury

🏦 The Show’s Treasury
The treasury fuels everything behind the scenes:

🎥 Production & Streaming Upgrades

📢 Marketing & Promotions

🌍 Platform Expansion

🎉 Weekly Community Jackpot Payouts

This isn’t just a token — it’s a system built to reward the people building with us.</li>
